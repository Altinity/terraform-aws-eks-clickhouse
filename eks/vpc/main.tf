# üö® This VPC module includes the creation of an Internet Gateway and public subnets, which simplifies cluster deployment and testing.
# IMPORTANT: For preprod and prod use cases, it is crucial to consult with your security team and AWS architects to design a private infrastructure solution that aligns with your security requirements.

# The VPC is configured with DNS support and hostnames,
# which are essential for EKS and other AWS services to operate correctly.
# ---
# Creates a series of public subnets within the VPC based on the var.subnets input variable,
# which contains details like CIDR blocks and availability zones.
