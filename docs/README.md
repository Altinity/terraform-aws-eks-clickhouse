# Terraform Module for EKS ClickHouse Cluster

This Terraform module automates the deployment of a [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) database cluster on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Elastic Kubernetes Service). It is designed to create and configure the necessary resources for a robust and scalable ClickHouse deployment.

The code is separated in different modules: one for the EKS cluster, one for ClickHouse operator (and Zookeeper Cluster), and one for ClickHouse cluster deployment. Variables are used to customize the deployment, including AWS region, cluster name, node configurations, and networking settings.

## Components

This architecture is provides a scalable, secure, and efficient environment for running a ClickHouse database on Kubernetes within AWS EKS. The focus on autoscaling, storage management, and proper IAM configurations its suitability for enterprise-level deployments using the following resources:

- **EKS Cluster**: Utilizes AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service to manage Kubernetes clusters. Configuration specifies version, node groups, and IAM roles for cluster operations.

- **VPC and Networking**: Sets up a VPC with subnets, internet gateway, and route tables for network isolation and internet access. Public subnets and an S3 VPC endpoint are created for external and internal communications, respectively.

- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Defines roles and policies for EKS cluster, node groups, and service accounts, facilitating secure interaction with AWS services.

- **ClickHouse Deployment**:
  - **Operator and Cluster**: Deploys ClickHouse using a custom Kubernetes operator, with configurations for namespace, user, and password.
  - **Zookeeper Integration**: Configures a Zookeeper cluster for ClickHouse coordination, deployed in its namespace.

- **Storage**:
  - **EBS CSI Driver**: Implements the Container Storage Interface (CSI) for EBS, enabling dynamic provisioning of block storage for stateful applications.
  - **Storage Classes**: Defines storage classes for gp3 encrypted EBS volumes, supporting dynamic volume provisioning.

- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Implements autoscaling for EKS node groups based on workload demands, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- **Security**:
  - **IAM OIDC Provider**: Establishes an IAM OIDC provider for the EKS cluster, allowing Kubernetes service accounts to assume IAM roles.
  - **Pod Identity**: Configures service accounts with IAM roles for fine-grained access control to AWS services.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed (recommended `<= v1.5`)
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and AWS services

## Usage

```hcl

module "aws_eks_clickhouse" {
  source  = "Altinity/eks-clickhouse/aws"
  version = "0.1.1"

  cluster_name = "clickhouse-cluster"
  region       = "us-east-1"
  cidr         = "10.0.0.0/16"
  subnets      = [
    { cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24", az = "${var.region}a" },
    { cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24", az = "${var.region}b" },
    { cidr_block = "10.0.3.0/24", az = "${var.region}c" }
  ]

  node_pools_config = {
    scaling_config = {
      desired_size = 2
      max_size     = 10
      min_size     = 0
    }

    disk_size      = 20
    instance_types = ["m5.large"]
  }

  tags = {
    CreatedBy = "mr-robot"
  }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The module will create a Node Pool for each combination of instance type and subnet. For example, if you have 3 subnets and 2 instance types, this module will create 6 different Node Pools.

## AWS Labs Blueprint

This module is the consequence of a collaboration between [Altinity](https://altinity.com) and [AWS Labs](https://awslabs.github.io/data-on-eks/). It is part of a series of tutorials to aim people do fancy stuff with data on AWS EKS (using different technologies)

You can find the complete blueprint [here](#), which use most of the code provided in this repo as a terraform module.
